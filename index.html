<p>I investigated the Lahman Database for Udacityâ€™s Intro to Data Analysis course. Originally, I was going to write a single report, but this data set affords a rich set of possibilities for inquiry. My plan is to write a series of reports focused on different questions of interest.</p>
<p>Reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing Batting Data: <a href="http://natereed.github.io/baseball-investigation/are-pitchers-good-at-batting">Are Pitchers Good at Batting?</a></li>
</ul>
